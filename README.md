# Javascript p2p chat

After a day of playing with Peer.js we successfully created a p2p chat program.

## To use

1. Either go to root and run `npm install; grunt`, which will download everything, run grunt and open up a browser at http://127.0.0.1:9001/ OR just open `/dist/index.html` in your browser.
2. Type in your name
3. Either host or join (if you host give a friend your ID, if you join you'll need someone's ID)
4. Once connected start chatting away!
